# Crypto Asset Recommendation API

This project provides a simple crypto asset recommendation system based on recent market data from the CoinGecko API.
It uses a heuristic scoring model to rank crypto assets by short-term investment potential — combining price momentum, market activity, and volatility.

## Overview

The system:

Fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.

Computes derived indicators such as:

Momentum: 7-day price change (%)

Volume Ratio: total_volume / market_cap

Volatility: short-term risk proxy

Applies a simple scoring formula:

score
=
0.5
×
momentum
+
0.3
×
volume ratio
−
0.2
×
volatility
score=0.5×momentum+0.3×volume ratio−0.2×volatility

Ranks and returns the top recommended crypto assets.

## Why These Weights?

The weights (0.5, 0.3, −0.2) are heuristic, chosen to:

Prioritize trend (momentum) the most (50% influence).

Still reward market strength/liquidity (30%).

Penalize instability (20%).

They represent a balanced, intuitive trade-off between rewarding performance and avoiding excessive risk.



The API is exposed through FastAPI and can be accessed locally via uvicorn.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Liorn09/fin_task.git
cd fin_task

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
